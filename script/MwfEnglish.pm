# Help

$lng->{help} = "

<p>Note: as the mwForum software is highly configurable, not all of the features 
mentioned below are necessarily enabled in this installation.</p>

<h3>Forum</h3>

<p>The forum is the whole installation, and usually contains multiple boards. 
You should always enter the forum through a link that ends in \"forum.pl\" (not 
\"forum_show.pl\") to let the forum know when you start a new session. Otherwise 
the forum won't know when to display posts as new or old.</p>

<h3>User</h3>

<p>A user is anyone who registers an account in the forum. Registration is 
usually not required for reading most boards, but depending on configuration 
only registered users will have access to certain boards and features.</p>

<h3>Group</h3>

<p>Users can be granted membership in user groups. Open groups can also be 
joined by users themselves. The groups in turn are granted member or moderator 
rights in selected boards, allowing members of the group to read and write in or 
moderate those boards.</p>

<h3>Board</h3>

<p>A board contains topics, which in turn contain the posts. Boards can be set 
to be visible to registered users or to moderators and board members only. 
Boards can optionally allow posts by unregistered guests. Announcement boards 
can be read-only, so that they only allow posts by moderators and members, or 
reply-only, which means that only moderators and members can start new topics, 
but everybody can reply. Another option for boards is moderation. If this option 
is activated, new posts will be invisible to normal users until a moderator 
approves them.</p>

<h3>Topic</h3>

<p>A topic, otherwise known as thread, contains all the posts on a specific 
subtopic, that should be named in the topic's subject. Boards have expiration 
values that determine after how many days their topics will expire or get locked 
after their last post has been made. Moderators can also manually lock topics, 
so that no replies can be made and no post can be edited anymore.</p>

<h3>Post</h3>

<p>A post is a public message by a user. It can be either a base post, which 
starts a new topic, or a reply to an existing topic. Posts can be edited and 
deleted, which may be limited to a certain time frame. Posts can be locked by 
moderators, making it impossible to reply or edit. Posts can be reported to the 
moderators in case of rule violations.</p>

<h3>Private Message</h3>

<p>In addition to the more or less public posts, private messages may be enabled 
in a forum. Registered users can send each other these messages without knowing 
the email addresses of the recipients.</p>

<h3>Administrator</h3>

<p>Administrators can control and edit everything in the forum. This means they 
can also act as moderators globally. Administrators are listed on the forum info 
page.</p>

<h3>Moderator</h3>

<p>Moderators' powers are limited to specific boards. They can edit, lock, 
delete and approve posts, lock and delete topics, and check the list of posts 
reported for rule violations. The user groups whose members have moderator 
rights in a board are listed on the board's info page.</p>

<h3>Polls</h3>

<p>The creator of a topic may be able to add a poll to that topic. Each poll can 
contain up to 20 options. Polls can allow one vote per registered users per 
poll, or alternatively multiple votes for different options at different points 
in time. Polls can't be edited, and can only be deleted as long as there haven't 
been any votes.</p>

<h3>Icons</h3>

<table>
<tr><td>
<img class='sic sic_post_nu' src='[[dataPath]]/epx.png' alt='N/U'>
<img class='sic sic_topic_nu' src='[[dataPath]]/epx.png' alt='N/U'>
<img class='sic sic_board_nu' src='[[dataPath]]/epx.png' alt='N/U'>
</td><td>
Yellow icons indicate new posts or topics and boards with new posts.
In this forum, \"new\" means a post has been added since your last visit. Even
if you have just read it, it is still a new post, and will only be counted as
old on your next visit to the forum.
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<img class='sic sic_post_or' src='[[dataPath]]/epx.png' alt='O/R'>
<img class='sic sic_topic_or' src='[[dataPath]]/epx.png' alt='O/R'>
<img class='sic sic_board_or' src='[[dataPath]]/epx.png' alt='O/R'>
</td><td>
Checkmarked icons indicate that the post or all posts in a topic or
board have been read. Posts are counted as read once their topic had been on
screen or if they're older than a set number of days. Since new/old and
unread/read are independent concepts in this forum, posts can be new and read
as well as old and unread at the same time.
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<img class='sic sic_post_i' src='[[dataPath]]/epx.png' alt='I'>
</td><td>
Indicates posts or topics that are invisible to other users, because they 
are waiting for approval by a moderator.
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<img class='sic sic_topic_l' src='[[dataPath]]/epx.png' alt='L'>
</td><td>
Indicates posts or topics that have been locked. No replies or edits are 
possible anymore.
</td></tr>
</table>

<h3>Markup Tags</h3>

<p>For security reasons, mwForum only supports its own set of markup tags, no 
HTML tags. Available markup tags:</p>

<table>
<tr><td>[b]text[/b]</td>
<td>renders text <b>bold</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>[i]text[/i]</td>
<td>renders text <i>italic</i></td></tr>
<tr><td>[tt]text[/tt]</td>
<td>renders text <code>nonproportional</code></td></tr>
<tr><td>[url]address[/url]</td>
<td>links to the address</td></tr>
<tr><td>[url=address]text[/url]</td>
<td>links to the address with the given text</td></tr>
<tr><td>[img]address[/img]</td>
<td>embeds a remote image (if enabled)</td></tr>
<tr><td>[img]filename[/img]</td>
<td>embeds an attached image</td></tr>
<tr><td>[img thb]filename[/img]</td>
<td>embeds an attached image's thumbnail (if available)</td></tr>
</table>

<h3>Quoting</h3>

<p>mwForum uses email-style quoting. To quote someone, simply copy&amp;paste a 
line of text from the original post and prefix it with a &gt; sign. It will then 
get highlighted in a different color. Please don't quote more text than 
necessary to establish context. Some forums may also have automatic quoting 
enabled, in that case please also trim down the quoted text to a minimum.</p>

<h3>Keyboard Navigation</h3>

<p>Posts on topic pages of threaded boards can be navigated with the WASD keys 
in the same way as typical tree view controls can be navigated with the cursor 
keys. In addition, the E key jumps to the next new or unread post.</p>

# FAQ

$lng->{faq} = "

<h3>Why don't old posts get displayed as old?</h3>

<p>You have to enter the forum through a link that ends in \"forum.pl\" (not 
\"forum_show.pl\") to let the forum know when you want to start a new session. 
Should you for whatever reason want to continue an old session without having 
posts marked as old, you can enter directly through \"forum_show.pl\".</p>

<h3>I lost my password, can you send it to me?</h3>

<p>The original password isn't stored anywhere for security reasons. But on the 
login page you can request an email with a ticket link that is valid for a 
limited time. After using that link to login, you can set a new password.</p>

<h3>Do I have to logout after a session?</h3>

<p>You only need to logout if you are using a device that is also used by
other non-trusted persons.</p>

<h3>How do I attach images and other files to posts?</h3>

<p>If attachments are enabled in the forum and the specific board you want to 
post in, first submit your post without the attachment, after that you can 
click the post's Attach button to go to the upload page. Posting and uploading 
is separated this way because uploads can fail for various reasons, and you 
probably don't want to lose your post text when that happens.</p>
